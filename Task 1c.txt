/*Task 1c - Write a java program to implement method overloading 

Problem Description - 
--------------------
Create a class Demo such that the class Contains three definitions of a method display() as follows - 

1. First definition of the method display(char c) should display a single character as given input by the user.
2. Second definition of the method display(char c, int num) should display a single character and
an integer as given input by the user.
3. Third definition of the method display(int num, double d) should display an integer 
and a double value as given input by the user

Constraints:
------------------
Students need to call the display methods of Demo class from MethodOverloading class and print the appropriate messages,
as per the test cases given below.

Input Format - 
--------------
First line of input should consist of a single character input.
Second line of input should consist of an integer.
Third line of input should consist of a double value.

Output Format - 
---------------
First line of output should display a single character.
The second line of output should display an integer and a character.
The third line of output should display and integer and a double.

Sample Test Case - 
-----------------
Input - 
-------
#
12
12.34

Output - 
-------
Value of character = #
Value of character = #
Value of Integer number = 12
Value of Integer number = 12
Value of Floating Number = 12.34

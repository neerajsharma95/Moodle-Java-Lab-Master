/*Task 5 Additional Problem 2
------------------------------
Write a java program that reads the first n lines of a given text file, n 
is taken based on user input.

Input Format :
----------------
- The first line of input should read the integer value for number of lines 
to be read.
- The second line of input should read a string value for the file name from 
where the data is to be read.

Output Format : 
---------------
- The output should display n number of lines from the file based on the 
user input.
- Refer the sample test cases for input and output format specification.
